This is work in progress towards a simple and stripped down dark theme for
`hieroglyph <http://hieroglyph.io>`__.

It is based on the theme ``slides2`` of `hieroglyph <http://hieroglyph.io>`__,
which, in turn, is based on the updated Google (~2013) I/O HTML slides
template.

Why didn't we inherit from the ``slides2`` theme, you ask? Because
a) the "parent" themes are not really under active development, so the
maintenance overhead to adopt changes is probably low (none);
b) we would have had to replace some files, which would have led to code
duplication anyway;
c) since we have to duplicate code, we can take the opportunity and do
a complete fork in order to clean up what we do not want.

keyboard shortcuts
==================

Not sure if they all work (#todo), but if found those keys wired up in
the source code:

right arrow, down arrow, page up, space
  next slide

left arrow, up arrow, page down, backspace
  previous slide

N
  toggle speaker notes

O
  toggle overview (currently broken â€“ needs CSS fixes)

P
  when pressed in the main window:
  enable & open the presenter window

  when pressed in the presenter window:
  disable & close the presenter window

  when the slides are not opened via ``file://``, the presenter mode
  is sticky, which means that it will re-open after reloading the main window

ESC
  hide notes, close overview

F
  toggle fullscreen
